Written using python3
All code was written by me. Some debugging and ideas on a matplotlib
from discussions on stackoverflow

1) Just type ./main.py
    The program will sort the lists and run them agains a custom written sorting function and
    the built in sort function to mak sure they are sorted and will print true or false in the console
    Once the sorting has been checked, the console requires a user prompt  to continue.
    The program will time the algorithms and plot an histogram of the various plots
