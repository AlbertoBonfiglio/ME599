Written using python3.5
All image processing code was written by me.
Some classes were imported from existing packages (opencv3, webcolors and event)
Ideas on how to process images to extrapolate differences from opencv documentation,
Pillow documentation and research on stack exchange

1) In main.py remove the comment from the functions to test
  save and then type ./main.py

2) It says lab 6 because the code is derived from the work we did in lab 6
